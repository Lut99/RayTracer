# RayTracer
The RayTracer repository is made for Lut99's ray tracing renderer. The first version is simple, but trust me, it gets complicated rather fast.

The first version is made using [this](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial.


# Future work
Right now, the Scene Creator is nothing more than using the C++ compiler to create a program that transforms hardcoded objects into the JSON files that the RayTracers reads. However, to improve upon this, conventional rendering could be used to make a realtime and therefore editable 3D scene, which can then be rendered into something pretty with the RayTracer. This might be a cool project to do once some basic features of the RayTracer are up and running (like optimisation and mesh loading).
